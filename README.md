# <Horiseon-Website>

## Description

- Preformed maintenance on the Horiseon homepage to improve readability and
  eliminate redundancy from HtML and CSS source code. 
- This was absolutely necessary as the previous designer was not very neat.
  There were several instances of copy/pasted code which simply served no purpose, as well many generic elements were used where semantic elements would accomplish the same thing.
- This edit serves to make the source code easier to interpret and edit for future
  designers.
- While working on this webpage I learned that sometimes less is more, and 
  a simple page is always better.
